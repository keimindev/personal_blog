**I’ve done build and released an Application called ’T.o.T’ finally.**
I had built an App with Expo and React-native. I’d like to write document in detail the process of releasing an app to the Store.
However, with each step forward, i faced to conflicts and frustrations that overwhelmed me and blank-minded that i couldn't keep any records. First of all, I try to write about what I felt and learned while building and releasing an Application.

## What is the motivation for releasing the App?

The beginning of T.o.T was simply a resolution : “I should dedicate 30 minutes a day to focused reading.”
The idea was to use a stopwatch to track the time spent on various activities throughout the day.
The first step was a web platform built with Next.js
I build a web application with MVP quickly and continuously add more ideas for improvement quality of product.
I had created a result with most of the features I wanted, and at first, I didn’t feel any inconvenience using it on a PC.
However, as I tried to log time while on the move, I started noticing several inconveniences when using it on a mobile device.
This led me to think about building it as a mobile application. I considered using a web-view with the current code, but
I saw the opportunity to gain experience in releasing an application on the App Store.

## The Challenges of App deployment

I build a React-Native Application using Expo. I’d never had experience building a mobile application before, I should learned it from official documents and several video contents from Youtube.
Wanting to quickly build and use it, I focused solely on targeting the iOS App Store. The actual coding part didn’t pose much of a challenge.

The main challenges the database and deployment.
I used a backend solution called “Appwrite” , which is an open-source service to providing functional APIs for building web and mobile applications. It makes it easy to manage various features, including storage, authentication, database etc.
However, despite the presence of detailed official documentation, building a user account deletion feature proved to be quite challenging. Since account deletion couldn't be handled on the client side due to security concerns, I debated whether I needed to develop the server-side myself. In the end, I resolved the issue by utilizing the API functionality provided by Appwrite.

I had always focused solely on the front-end side when building products, which revealed my lack of awareness regarding data management. When a user deletes their account, all of their associated resources need to be removed as well.
Initially, I thought it was as simple as just deleting the account, but it took me some time to realize that it wasn’t the case.

To distribute the app on the App Store, I had to register for Apple Developer, but this process consumed so much time that it felt like a series of endless frustrations. First, I faced the inconvenience of not being able to register my Apple account. After finally managing to make the payment, another issue arose where Apple didn't send a subscription confirmation. I ended up spending over a week just getting the account registered, even reaching out to Apple for support.

When I submitted the app for review for the first time, it was rejected due to the lack of a user deletion feature related to private data. After adding the necessary functionality and resubmitting, the app was finally approved and launched.

## Lessons learned while building an App

Actually deploying an app made me wonder, "How do mobile developers work?" I also realized how much attention is required for even the smallest details when creating a product. Although I launched the app, I couldn't help but feel that it was quite basic and modest. Even while it was functioning, I kept thinking, "Ah, this is a bug, I need to fix this," and the list of things I wanted to improve kept growing.
From a design perspective, I also wanted to make some improvements, but I wasn’t sure where or how to start. Thoughts like, "Wouldn't it be more convenient if it had this feature?" kept popping up, and all I could see were areas that felt lacking or needed enhancement.

To launch an app on the App Store, you need to pay attention to both the product and the marketing side. An icon is necessary, you need a detailed page for the app’s description, and a product introduction page for marketing purposes. While it's easy to think that these things can be made simply, they kept bothering me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to pay more attention to these aspects.

## Goals

I thought the goal was to launch the app. I thought it would be over once the app was launched, but in reality, it’s not the end.
Now, I have ideas for features that would be nice to add, and I keep thinking about how some parts are still lacking.
I will set the next goal and continue improving the app.
Currently, there’s just the stopwatch, but I’d like to add a timer function, and also allow users to set their own routine activities instead of just the pre-set ones.
There are many things I want to develop further. The details that need improvement also stand out, so I’ll continue to fix and enhance them.
