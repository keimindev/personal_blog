## Summary

[T.O.T](https://github.com/keimindev/tot_app) is a time-tracking web platform. It serves as a time record book where users can track how much they read and study each day, allowing them to monitor their activities for the month.

### **A Time Tracking Journal Started to Create a Routine**

I've been striving to create a routine by dedicating **`30 minutes of reading`** every day. However, I found it difficult to track my monthly or weekly reading time using the existing book apps, and there was also inconvenience as I mainly read original books. Therefore, I decided to create my own journal.

Since it's primarily for tracking my reading time, I aimed to complete version 1 development without adding any additional sections. I chose to use **`Next.js`** to quickly build the server. In the future, I plan to further develop the journal by implementing it in a calendar format and adding additional sections for recording time other than reading.

- **Main Features:**
  - Stopwatch
  - Record total activity by day
  - Record time by sections(study, reading, workout, etc...)
  - Confirm your record in Last month
  - Show Bar Chart day record compared to average for Monthly Goal
