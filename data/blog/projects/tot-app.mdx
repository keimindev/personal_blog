## Summary

### **A Time Tracking Journal Started to Create a Routine**

I've been striving to create a routine by dedicating **`30 minutes of reading`** every day. However, I found it difficult to track my monthly or weekly reading time using the existing book apps, and there was also inconvenience as I mainly read original books. Therefore, I decided to create my own journal.

[T.O.T](https://github.com/keimindev/tot_app) is a time-tracking application. It serves as a time record book where users can track how much they read and study each day, allowing them to monitor their activities for the month.
I started with a web platform, but as I kept testing and using it, I began to think about launching it as an app as well. I considered using a web view to release it as an app, but ultimately, I decided to rebuild it with React Native for a more mobile-friendly design.

- **Main Features:**
  - Stopwatch mode
  - Record total activity by day
  - Record time by sections(study, reading, workout, etc...)
  - Weekly record review
  - Monthly goal setting
