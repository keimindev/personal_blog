## Summary

[T.O.T](https://tot-web.vercel.app/) is a time-tracking web platform. It serves as a time record book where users can track how much they read and study each day, allowing them to monitor their activities for the month.

### **A Time Tracking Journal Started to Create a Routine**

I've been striving to create a routine by dedicating **`30 minutes of reading`** every day. However, I found it difficult to track my monthly or weekly reading time using the existing book apps, and there was also inconvenience as I mainly read original books. Therefore, I decided to create my own journal.

Since it's primarily for tracking my reading time, I aimed to complete version 1 development without adding any additional sections. I chose to use **`Next.js`** to quickly build the server. In the future, I plan to further develop the journal by implementing it in a calendar format and adding additional sections for recording time other than reading.

- **Website Goals:**
  - Stopwatch
  - Record total activity by day
  - Record time by sections(study, reading, workout, etc...)

## Achivement

I tackled the challenge of creating a time tracking platform by choosing to build with `Next.js`, leveraging my prior experience and its built-in API routes. Initially planning to use just `React`, I opted for `Next.js` to avoid additional backend frameworks. Despite my limited understanding of `Next.js` beyond `React`, I found the official documentation invaluable. Starting with a simple wireframe and essential features, I soon realized the importance of design for user experience. My focus shifted from quick feature implementation to considering user convenience and value. I planned and developed additional pages and features from the user's perspective. This project taught me that user-centric design is as crucial as clean code. It was a valuable experience in balancing functionality and user satisfaction.
